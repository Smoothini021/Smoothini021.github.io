        <div class = "beginnings">
        <h2 id="beginnings">Beginnings</h2>
        <h6>1988 - 2020</h6>
        
        <p>You never realize the exact moment when human's who you can fully interact with, have things in common with, admire and can learn from are significantly younger than you. In other words, you never get a memo that tells you, "hey you are old!"</p>
        <p>Which is good for me since I'm not old. At least in my mind, but as I type this I have to embrace that in 5 months I will be <em>40 years old</em>. Even as I read these words on the screen, I just don't believe it. I have spent my entire adult life acting like a kid. Getting paid to be silly.</P>
        <p>For the past 11 years I meet tourists on the most amazing weeks of their lives as I entertain them her in <em>Fabulous Las Vegas</em> as a bar magician. Even when I'm filming for television, or traveling the world to perform shows, I still get paid to be fun and carefree. So maybe being a real adult never sank into my mind.</p>
        <p>This is very different than my previous job before this. I was a United States Marine. There I really had to be mature. I had to be tough. I did it pretty well, but that wasn't my life calling.</p>
        <p>Towards the end of 2019 my first TV show was under pre-production for a season 2. Other TV show's were calling me for me to make guest appearances. My children were doing great at school and my wife got a promotion not so long ago. It was the perfect time for me to expand my career. And then CoronaVirus came to town. Las Vegas was shut down. With no one to perform magic to, I had nothting to do.</p>
        <p>The TV show's weren't calling. Why would they? How could they film? But I wasn't worried. I had tricks to learn. Things to organize. Plans to make. Plus I have 3 kids at home that need me to help them with school work. It wasn't like I was going to be bored.</p>
        <p>Then something strange happened. Maybe after like week 3 of staying at home. See it was the first time in about 20 years where I didn't perform magic. I wasn't out and about performing. I wasn't acting like a kid. I had to confront something that I never had time to really think about. I'm about to be <em>40 years old</em> this year and maybe running around the Las Vegas strip in the middle of the night with tourists is going to get pretty weird for me when I'm in my 50's. I should consider not a career change, but a way to evolve my magic career.</p>
        <p>Lucky for me I have been helping my kids on <strong>Khan Academy</strong> for months. With the stay-at-home policy I had to help them even more. That is when I noticed the Computer Programming option on my son's Learner Page. Yeah, he is only 5 years old, but why not?</p>
        <p>The rest is pretty much history. I got off his profile and realized I had my own Khan Acadmey profile for when I signed the kids up. I started going through the JavaScript classes and was hooked.</p>
        <p>Even though it's only been 2 months since I have started I say I absolutely plan to use this to further my magic career. I want to learn enough to maybe one day make an app that either teaches magic tricks or can actually do a magic trick to you.</p>
        <p>Or I can help make software to help gig workers (magicians, comedians, dancers, actors, etc.) manage their clients, market their services, or do their taxes. Really, I plan to use my 32 years of being in Show Business, marry that with some skills in coding, to move my career to another level. That way I don't have to be on stage for the rest of my life. I might be getting ahead of myself. Yet that is the way I have always been.</p>
        <p>I'm not sure if I will get to all my dreams, but I do really enjoy following my dreams. I have gotten so good in magic that I have become one of the world's best. In fact, if you google the term <strong>Bar Magician</strong> I am the first person that show's up. That is why I am confident that if I dedicate myself, not only will I be a decent programmer, I can find a way to make a decent living out of it. And use that new skill to enhance what it is I do on a stage.</p>
        <p>I started magic at age 8 in the year 1988. Joined the United States Marine Corps at age 21 in the year 2001. Became a full time magician at age 25 in the year 2005. A sem-finalist on America's Got Talent in 2014 and the host of my very own TV series in 2018. Hey, I say thank you to the CoronaVirus. Because 2020 will be the year I start coding, and I will master this too!</p>
        <p>If you are reading this (and thank you if you are) then I hope this story has a great ending. Because I can't tell you from now which way it will go.</p>

        <!-- 5/17/2020 Goals -->
        <div class = "goals">
        <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
        <h6>Spring 2020</h6>
        
        <p>Before the world went into a freefall I was working on  a few goals. Getting ready for a second season of my award winning TV series <em>Hip-Hop Houdini</em>. Trying to get the show to be picked up by NetFlix after Amazon Prime started showing it. Working on a nationwide tour. Trying to get my stage show in a different location here in Las Vegas. Plannig a road trip with my family and a few other things.</p>
        <p>Things were going ok and then my father passed away in February. Soon after the planet went on lockdown. Considering that I am a bar magician, not having restaurants & bar's to perform at is going to be quite a challenge for me overcome. The sensible / responsible thing for me to do is to consider a complete career change.</p>
        <p>In fact every responsible adult I know is pretty much telling me to quit magic and get "a real job". After being self-employed for 15 years I can pretty much look forward to being a receptionist, a bar-back, a janitor, a low-wage security guard, or the guy that bags your grocery. Oooh maybe I can be a clerk at a 7-11 or greet people at Wal-mart!!!</p>
        <p>Yeah, going from being on stage in front of hundreds of people, or going to parties and entertaining the rich & famous, this isn't an option. Or is it?</p>
        <p>As I write this blog, I will document my 2020. How I went from a promising beginning of a new decade in January, to my life being upended in February with the death of my father, then to the soul-searching that started in March with the quarantine. To the upcoming months as I go through this summer. The start of the new school year for my kids, and then the fall when I turn 40. What I really hope is that by the time December comes I can read back at this and see that I have taken control of my career.  </p>
        <p>So let's outline some goals to accomplish by the end of the year:</p>
        <ul class = "goal_list">
            <li>Be proficient in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with my personal webpage up and running.</li>
            <li>Drive to North County San Diego and perform a come-back show. </li>
            <li>Start pre-production on a TV special.</li>
            <li>Complete the map of Fairford. The fictional town of my book "Over the Wall".</li>
            <li>Start an interactive magic school for extra income.</li>
            <li>Teach my twins chess.</li>
            <li>Set up my home office.</li>
            <li>Get my weight to 180lbs (currently 190.4 and feel great but if I want to get back on TV, I should lose my quarantine belly.)</li>
            <li>Finish my logo.</li>
            <li>Visit my mother in NYC.</li>
            <li>Do career day at my kid's school.</li>
            <li>Get a new weekly gig on the Vegas Strip.</li>
            <li>Create and program 1 game with JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I can go on and on with goals, but I have a lot of things to do. It will be tough. If I stick to this it will be fun to look back at this blog. The tough part is that I have 3 kids at home all day, everyday and it's hard to get anything done AND try ot be sure they are entertained and are doing educational things. Plus making sure my wife get's attention, the house is cleaned, dinner is made, etc. The kid's won't go back to school until maybe September which is 4 months away.</P>
        <p>So let's begin the journey. What is weird is that I think I'm the only one that is going to read this. Unless, of course, I actually do this the right way and I get some fan's to read this in the far future. That or one of my kid's 20 years from now curious about their dead. Oooh maybe some historian in like 200 years. Either way, I wish I had the power you have to just read the end and see how it turns out.</p>

        <div class = "beginnings">
        <h2 id="entries">Blog Entries</h2>
        <p>I have an interesting history when it comes to journal's. In High School I kept a few journal's spanning a few years in notebooks. This, obviously, was before computer's were cheap enough that practically everyone had one. I grew up somewhat poor. </p>
        <p>I have always loved writing. Stories, poetry, essays, thoughts and puzzles. Sad that I lost all my notebooks in a fire while I was off in Kuwait during the war in 2003.</p>
        <p>When I was stationed in Okinawa, Japan I started a blog and I wrote a few entries into it. It is still on the internet, although the stuff I wrote in it isn't things I'm very proud of. At some point I talked a lot of crap about an ex girlfriend who was nothing but nice to me. Young boy stuff. Either way, I must've hurt her feelings really badly. </p>
        <p>The past few years I haven't really wrote down my day to day thoughts and feelings. Instead I have just decided that all my facebook statuses will be my journal. It really isn't the same.</p>
        <p>So the question is, what exactly do I write down? What I did in that day? How I feel? Did I get any closer to my goals? I'm not sure. There is also a part of me that hopes someone actually reads this. So the entertainer in me wants it to be exciting. Or funny. Or at least amusing. So here we go. The month of May.</p>

        <h6>Monday 11:57pm PST</h6>
        <p>Finally everyone in the house is asleep. Well at least to bed. Seem's like my daughter Liana is still up. I have Star Trek: Enterprise playing on Amazon Prime. Season 3, episode 14: Strategem. Since last November I have been watching all the Star Trek in order so I can work my way up to watching Picard. Maybe later on I'll talk about what it means to me.</p>
        <p>I want to say today was eventful. I want to say I was particularly productive, yet I can't. Well for the first time I walked the dog the furtherst west I have yet. Since the quarantine I have kept close to home, but today I walked to new grounds. Found out there is a hotel not too far from me. I fantasize about renting a room for a few nights just so I can be alone at night. It will never happen, but these are the things that cross my mind. It isn't that I don't want to be with my family. On the contrary. Yet being ALL DAY with the kids, and then finally being able to carve a few minutes to myself for real at night isn't enough. Of course my wife doesn't get it. She has an office she can go to. A change of scenary. Adults to interact with. Me, I'm like held hostage. </p>
        <p>I want to move forward with my JavaScript learning but I'm stuck on this project. I have an overcomplicated system for studying. One that get's interrupted all day long. Now that it is night time, I'm getting sleepy. In the morning I have to help with school work, stop the kids from fighting, make lunch, make dinner, take the dog to a walk and give up the computer and/or tablets. </p>
        <p>That's what happened today. My wife came home early, but my step-daughter needed the computer for her school work. Then my wife got on her laptop for her work. By the time I had access I was fastly making dinner. Ham steaks glazed with brown sugar. No butter so I used olive oil. It was delicious. After I ate I put an Animaniacs movie for the twins and took our dog, Princess Leia, on a one heck of a walk. </p>
        <p>It seems that my brother is coming from California this weekend, which is good. But I do know that it's going to throw my routine in chaos. He's going to be curious why I'm learning programming, what does it mean, am I changing careers, how much money do I expect to make, etc., etc. and I don't want to answer all those questions. Mainly because I don't know the answers and I just want to keep learning.</p>
        <p>I want to move on from this blog project. I gave myself some criteria. I'm going to fill in the magic section at the minimum. What I really want to do is focus on the CSS.</p>
        <p>I'm not sure to what extent I can really bedazzle this project. I am so eager to do cool things. What I saw on CSS Zen Garden blew my mind. I'm aware of the existence of bootstrap and other stylesheet's that I can link to. Yet not sure if I can do that on Khan Acadmey.</p>
        <p>I really want to be able to change the whole screen and have a dropdown menu so that people can really navigate through this. It will be nice if other members of Khan Academy could come to this page, learn some magic tricks and get to know that side of me. I guess deep inside it's so I know that I'm not quitting on magic. Being an adult sucks. I have to remind myself that I'm doing the right thing. I am putting so much time to learn how to code. I just hope that it's for the right reasons, and not just a way to kill time while we are staying at home. Because if so, I could've spent the past few weeks being a dad, a husband, a brother, a son and a friend intead of spending hours a day telling myself I'm studying.</p>

        <div class="blog-entry"> 
        <h2 id="2" class="blog-entry-title">5/19/20</h2>
        <h6>Tuesday 11:23PM PST</h6>
        <p>Tomorrow is my twin's, and step-daughters, last day of school. Which means the twins don't get a kindgergarten graduation. Not that it matters to them, but for my wife and I it's these things that count. So today I spent a little bit of time working on my son's Noah's end of year project.</p>
        <p>Other than that, spent the day attempting to work on coding while the kids were watching the Simpson's and other programs. Somehow the day escaped me.</p>
        <p>On the positive side I did re-start my first JavaScriptprogram. At the end of the first part of the JavaScript tutorials on Khan Academy it has you plan your first program. Instead of doing it, I went ahead doing this and learning more JavaScript on Plural Sight and W3Schools. I lost my free membership on Plural Sight but kept learning on W3Schools. </p>
        <p>After yesterday's blog entry it occured to me that I'm post-poning actually writing code. I read and read and read thinking that I'm not getting what I'm learning. Yet maybe I just need to start coding and hope that it sticks to me.</p>
        <p>The idea of my first real program comes from the fact that I have always been decent with drawing. So I have always drawn cartoons for my kids. I have this drawing I did of SpongeBob and my son asked me if I could code it. And go figure, I was somewhat able to.</p>
        <p>My next logical course was to see if I can make a menu so that people can pick the cartoon they want to see. Then pick character's from that cartoon universe.</p> 
        <p>I stopped for a month because it was getting so tedious drawing every line and such. Then this other person on Khan Academy told me I can use the popMatrix() function. A big part of me didn't want to use it until I got taught it, but now I have thrown that out the window. It is time I start coding.</p>
        <p>My next part is to add CSS to this blog. Add some of the magic articles I want to add. That way I can move on. It isn't a good feeling to believe that I'm making zero progress on this new journey of mine.</p>

    <h2>Personal History in Magic</h2>
    <p>In the 1980's the illusionist <em>David Copperfield</em> did these epic TV specials. This is before On Demand. Before streaming. And years before the internet was affordable and even then the internet wasn't ready for reliable video. </p>
    <p>Those specials would teach a trick or two, but that motivated me to take magic books out of the New York City library and try to learn tricks myself.</p>
